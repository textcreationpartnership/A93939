            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But yet I was no little animated, when I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how much your LORD-ſhip was pleaſed to favour me as to condeſcend, that this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe might beare in the front your HONOURS name inſcribed; I confeſſe it is too unequall a taske for one of my yeares, &amp; ſo little verſt in the curioſity of either language, the ſubject being ſo ſerious, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of paſſages ſo full, &amp; the Authors expreſſions, not

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately left off our Country Schooles, I was not minded to loſe that little I had learned; wherefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed my ſelfe to peruſe ſome of the beſt latine authors; and though I ſought to better my ſelfe in the language, yet to digge and labour in the Quarry of choice words, and ſtill to be hewing and ſquaring out latine phraſes, onely I thought too ſervile, unleſſe the matter it ſelfe alſo yeelded ſome ſweetneſſe and content: which made me walke forth into the pleaſant fields of Hiſtory, in which I found a rare mixture of pleaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, where the matter it ſelfe with variety of paſſages informeth and delighteth the underſtanding, and the elegant words and delivery teacheth the tongue and pen to expreſſe. Amongſt the reſt, I fell upon a moderne maſter-piece in that kinde, viz. <hi>Famia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Strada</hi> of the Low-country Warrs, and of all other parts, I was moſt taken (and not without juſt reaſon) with the Siege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> contained in the ſixth, and part of the ſeventh booke of his ſecond decade. A compleate Hiſtory of it ſelfe, and to
<pb facs="tcp:119706:5"/>thoſe that underſtand it in the Originall, as exact a piece perhaps, as hither to hath beene publiſhed, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither worth in the actours, nor ability in the writer. This for my owne private practiſe I aſſayed to tranſlate; which after ſhewing to ſome friends (to whoſe judgement and anthority it were preſumption in me not to ſubſcribe) their pleaſure and deſire was to have it ſent to the preſſe. Nor doe I doubt, but if in playing the Tranſlators part I could neer have paralel'd the latine relation, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had beene wanting to have made this ſmall Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe appearing in our Country habit gratefull to the peruſers. But how can that bee expected from a Schoole-boy? for neither by age, nor knowledge, dare I aſſume more to my ſelfe, having not paſſed the eighteenth yeare of my age, nor ſaluted any U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, or Schoole of more eminent learning, nor yet travelled to converſe with thoſe of a more terſe ſtyle, and conſequently leſſe able to treate of ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a ſubject, and ſhadow in our native colours the deepe expreſsions and language of ſo grave an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. For my preſumption herein I expect not but to be cenſured, when others of greater ability have not eſcaped the browes of Critickes. But yet my nonage may afford mee this advantage, that what others point at as a fault, I may learne to amend; for as yet I cannot deſpaire of bettering my ſelfe in learning for the future.</p>
            <p>The right Worſhipfull Sir <hi>Robert Stapylton</hi> hath highly merited of our Country men, by ſowing
<pb facs="tcp:119706:5"/>this field with our Engliſh ſeede, having with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite skill and generall applauſe to their pleaſures and profits publiſhed the firſt Decade of <hi>Strada,</hi> and may perhaps produce the ſecond, of which this is a part. Why doe I then preſume to thruſt my ſickle into his corne? That worthy learned man I truſt, will not be offended, if I gleane one ſheafe out of his rich harveſt, who will thereby neither become poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, nor his worke of leſſe value even in this part, when the judicious Reader ſhall ſee how far his pure language and expreſsions doe ſurpaſſe thoſe bare lines of mine: the whole diſparagement will fall upon my ſelfe. As for the injury I may ſeeme to doe to the Author by not publiſhing the whole worke, how can that bee imputed to me as a crime? Hee wants not his due deſert in the Originall, nor is hee wronged, if neither I nor any elſe ſhould make him a Denizon of our Country? Why then ſhould I bee taxed for making him free at leaſt in part. Nor wants there examples which may render me irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible in both: and in particular, have not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall tuned Horace his Lyre, to keepe conſort with our Engliſh Vyoll, ſung ſome, yea even the ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect parts of that Roman Muſe, and not the whole worke, and have neither been cenſured, nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of their deſerved bayes. The like may wee ſay of that learned Caledonian, who hath taught <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpeake her owne language more refined, and yet hath at leaſt tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe been inſtructed in the Dialect of his owne Iſland. Nor laſtly, can the Reader juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:119706:6"/>complaine for wanting the whole worke, both for the reaſons before mentioned, and eſpecially for that I ſerve him with one compleat diſh, as well ſeaſoned as my skill for the preſent will afford; an exact, entyre, full hiſtory of it ſelfe, where the actours and relator, ſeeme to contend, which ſhall beare away the palme. And admit the whole Decade be printed, yet this part by it ſelfe may alſo take; for ſometimes a ſmall treatiſe hath gotten peruſall, when a greater volume hath been caſt aſide. What more to ſay I have not, but only to requeſt thee not to be too rigid a cenſurer, but rather to favour my weak beginnings, and if any thing be miſtaken, any thing defective, I ſhall be as ready to correct, as thou to find faults. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119706:8"/>ſhips, but even of whole Navies; yea ſometies there have been numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two thouſand ſhips in the port and river: whence trafficking with a great part of the world, the River playes not onely the Merchant, by bringing in all forraine commodities, but the warriour alſo for Auxiliary forces.<note place="margin">The conſultation of beſieging it.</note> But how much ſecurer the Anwerpians were, ſo much the more cautious were <hi>Alexanders</hi> Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. There were preſent at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, beſides Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and the reſt of the regall Senate never wont to be abſent, <hi>Mondragonius, Billius, Olivera,</hi> and <hi>Pacius,</hi> all Spaniards of <hi>Belgians,</hi> there were <hi>Mottaeus, Goigne,</hi> and <hi>Licquius,</hi> for the reſt of the Low-country men were abſent: of others, there were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus à Monte, George Baſta,</hi> and <hi>Camillus Capiſuccus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moſt are againſt it.</note> Moſt of theſe were even amazed with the greatneſſe of the propoſed deſigne, and thought the attempt more bold, then could be brought to a proſperous end. For ſaid they, he who would think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging <hi>Antwerp,</hi> ought ſeriouſly to conſider whether hee have ſufficient forces, wherewith at the ſame time, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119706:8"/>may block it up by land in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and by the river on <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide: For it were in vaine to beſiege it by land, to which by the river: if not from above from <hi>Gaunt,</hi> at leaſt from below, to witt, from the Sea, both proviſion and reliefe may continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought in. But the river was ſo broad, that it could not be blockt up by leſſe then two armies on either ſide one. Wherefore hee had need of three armies, who from Brabant, and either banke of the river <hi>Scheldt,</hi> might ſtop reliefe. But that would not be done, by reaſon of his ſmall forces. Neither had he ſufficient ſhipps wherewith to hinder the enemies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie about to enter the river from the ſea. To theſe things added <hi>Billius,</hi> that the complaints of the Soudiers more troubled him, who being defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their pay, not comming from Spaine, almoſt hungerſtarved, and moſt of them halfe naked, verily were unfit to be brought to a ſiege, of more then one moneths continuance. Nor did <hi>Pacius</hi> and <hi>Montius</hi> omit, that it was ſeriouſly to bee thought on, whether it were beſt to begin <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> ſiege, leaving <hi>Dendermund.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119706:9"/>Gaunt,</hi> and other holds behind him, from whence the enemy with free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, might diſturbe the bringing in of proviſion unto the Army, and the raiſing of Fortifications. Laſtly, all except <hi>Mondragonius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note> and <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccus,</hi> who committed all to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> fortune, thought it unſafe, and unſeaſonable, to ſet upon ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes with ſo ſmall forces. Therefore turning from the ſiege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> to beſiege <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And ſtrive to divert his minde from the ſiege.</note> they ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him with joynt prayers: and objecting the danger of loſing both his and their owne honours, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſubdue his minde in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſtill immoveable.<note place="margin">But his opinion is to beſiege it.</note> But hee commending their care, in the firſt place ſaid, that he had reflected on all thoſe things which they conceived to be the greateſt dangers. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he did not thinke, but that after they had heard him reaſon a little on the matter, they would think better of the ſucceſs. Then hee began much after this manner: <q>That hee had not the thought of invading <hi>Antwerp,</hi> before he was encouraged by pious men, that it would be acceptable to God: and had known the Kings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119706:9"/>minde concerning it. Neither did he doubt that human and ordinary helps would be wanting, which for the preſent might perſwade the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. For, he certainly knew, that the enemies were never in like fear, being within few months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with ſo many and ſo great loſſes by the Kings Army; <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of the Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range's counſells, out of hope of ſuccour from the French, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt ſo many Townes and Caſtles, nere adjoyning to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</hi> And ſurely, when the walls being battered, do tremble and ſhake, then with greater certainty may the aſſault be purſued. And from thence had he greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to aſſail the affrighted enemies, even in their chiefeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of war, and to carry that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour through the ſtrong holds of <hi>Brabant:</hi> not with vain hope, that they will for fear of loſing <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> either ſlight other places; or, for fear of loſing other places, will not be able to defend it. Indeed he had but few forces to ſet upon ſo many things with; but, they were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119706:10"/>skilfull in war accuſtomed to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and, which is above all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by great commanders. For, unto which of your hands here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, might not one ſafely deliver the charge of an Army? FOR, by the skill of Captains, and prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe of Souldiers, an Army is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. And be they never ſo many, thoſe be but few who conclude the victory. As of a ſpear, how long ſoever the palm only of the cuſpe doth all the execution. GREAT forces are not alwaies to be wiſhed for in war, no more then great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being for the moſt part ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many infirmities, us'd to be more pamper'd, move ſlowlier, and are but fairer marks to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at. Nor had he caſt over with himſelfe ſo to win <hi>Antwerp,</hi> that it was needfull to imploy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souldiers about it; ſith that by land, a few troopes of Horſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inroades into the territories of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> between <hi>Liere, Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> and <hi>Breda,</hi> Townes of the Kings party, might eaſily hinder traffick. And by the River, towards the Ocean (from whence the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119706:10"/>force of the enemy was to be feared) he had determined, either to take the Caſtles on both ſides the River; or, to build new ones; and from thence with Canon ſhot to reſtrain the Ships paſſage, if not all, at leaſt ſo much, as that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants might perceive their loſſe, and the City, full of Inhabitants might be wearied out for want of proviſion. Nor ſeemed thoſe forces which for the preſent he had with him, unable to perform theſe things: Nor did he doubt of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the work, having try'd, that his Souldiers were more couragious in battle, then mutinous in their quarters: But, leſt they ſhould be diſcouraged, he had lately received a ſumme of mony from the King, which he would divide amongſt his Veterans; for thoſe that were newly come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived pay. Although it was not to be feared, but that his Souldiers would willingly undergo the ſiege of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> from which ſo great booty might be expected. There were many yet in the Army, who, about eight years ſince, had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119706:11"/>experience of the riches of that Empory, the yet memory whereof inciting them, they will doubtleſſe enkindle in their fellowes the deſire of like plunder. Laſtly, for ſecurity of the Army, he had provided, that proviſion might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the territories of <hi>Waſia,</hi> be conveyed unto the Camp. Nor had he ſo left <hi>Gaunt</hi> and <hi>Dender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> behinde, that the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had any cauſe to fear; for they would have enough to do, to defend themſelves from our Souldiers, plac'd in Caſtles, newly rais'd thereabout. Wherefore, ſeeing that many things for the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him, no reaſons appeared ſufficient to withdraw him from it; let them leave that only determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him, and with great and conſtant courages begin the Siege of <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and from whence he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the acceſſe of all <hi>Brabant</hi> would follow: And they might be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Mother of God, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſſe of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> having been wickedly baniſhed from her own City by Hereſie, they now, refuſing no perill, to reſtore her to her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

               </note> and placed about five foot one from another, were faſtened into the River by a wonderfull and quick invention.<note place="margin">Its beginning on <hi>Flanders</hi> bank on Piles thus placed.</note> After theſe, there were as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the firſt, eleven foot, and five foot one from another: from theſe about thirteene foot off were three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and from theſe ſucceeded three others, eleven foot diſtant; and thus by courſe, as it were ſeverall couples, ſome eleven, and ſome thirteene foot aſunder, they were ſo farre extended into the middle of the River, that by reaſon of the depth of the Channell, and violent courſe of the waters, there could not any more Trees how long ſoever be faſtened, twelve piles of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty foot long being fixed in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119706:24"/>almoſt in a Quadrangle, to be the baſis or ground-work of the Caſtle, finiſhed this part of the Pile-work, and the topps of all the Piles before-mentioned joyned together by beams laid length-way, connected by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart-planks like lattiſſes were for the Cauſey, or floore of the Bridge: On the out-ſide in the mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene every Ternall of Piles, there was a beame ſtanding out five foot from the ſaid piles ſtruck faſt into the Waters: which by two other beams as it were Armes, taking hold of two of the adverſe Piles, in form of a wedge bound faſt the whole work to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite beames. And this was obſerved in every ternall juncture on both ſides the foundation. But yet more diſtant outwardly, on either ſide there went along another row of Piles over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe which were placed three in a rank, about twenty foot off, from the bottome of which, to about the ſuperficies of the Water, were raiſed great props, which being put under the ſharp Angles of the former work, and in the middle meeting together croſ-wiſe like claſpes joined together the inner Piles, and there by wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtrengthned the whole Machine.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119706:24"/>The work thus ordered,<note place="margin">The way over the bridge upon beames boarded and fenced.</note> boards were laid over the former Floore, to make even the paſſage over the Bridge, which was ſecurely flancked on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide againſt Muſquet-ſhot, with ſtrong and firme Plancks, five foot high, with a Parapet of two foot, with like ſolid boards was the Caſtle, the intended ſtation of the Souldiery in the furtheſt part of the work fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               </note> But as ſoon as the Winter began to diſſolve, and leſſe feare of the Ice they returned to their work.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119706:33"/>they could freely and in full force aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail the bridge. And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the ſtructure of this Machine. Before the Navall bridge,<note place="margin">Of the kinde of ſtructure.</note> but about a darts caſt off, there were thirty three boats, placed three and three together, their ſides ſomewhat diſtant one from another, faſtned together with huge beames layd over, and ſhippes Maſts. Then three others connected after the ſame manner, but ſeparated from the firſt three a little diſtance: ſo againe others, ſucceeded with equall diſtance, even unto the eleventh Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Beſides, from every one of theſe Ternalls, ſtood out forty beames in a forked order, being very long, round, and their points ſharpned with iron; which like Pike-men in the front of an Army, might terrify with their points ſet and turned againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, thoſe that advanced againſt them. Theſe Boats were fill'd with empty Hogs-heads, leſt they ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, either by the ſtreame or tyde: theſe were on either ſide ſtayed with Anchors, but their Cables long and ſlack, that the River riſing with the tyde, they might alſo riſe with it, therefore they call'd them <hi>Floates.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:119706:33"/>The one of theſe Engines, for there were two were plac't towards <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> the other towards the Ocean, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe being one thouſand two hundred and fifty two foot long, were ſo farre extended into the breadth of the River, that they might by their oppoſition and hinderance, defend all the Navall bridge, and part of the Caſtles.

                  <hi>Aldegunds</hi> judgement of it.</note> that a River of that <q>nature, could by mortall hands be obſtructed.</q> And verily amongſt all the Ancients, one can hardly read of a more exquiſite and rare piece of work.

               <note place="margin">Compared to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Bridge.</note> to be by Hiſtorians made famous. But <hi>Caeſars</hi> bridge on the <hi>Rheine</hi> was erected on a far ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by reaſon of the Summer time more ſhallow place. <hi>Alexanders</hi> bridled a river broader, almoſt by the halfe, hard by the Ocean, yea mixt with it, and toſſed by the fury of that Element.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119706:35"/>hand, moſt things to fetch afar off, now ſurprized by the Engliſh, then by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> alwayes in danger of the enemies. And that <hi>Caeſars</hi> bridge was but for a ſhort time to be uſed, to wit, for once tranſporting of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and therefore did not need to be of that ſtability, as of neceſſity <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> muſt, to hold out a ſiege of many moneths continuance. Laſtly, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtood in no dread of enemies, who, as ſoon as the bridge began to be erected, fled away, <hi>Alexander</hi> in ſight of an hoſtile and moſt potent City, erected a Bridge amongſt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, reſtleſſe by the Tyde of the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ocean,<note place="margin">Antwerp.</note> betwixt <hi>Antwerp</hi> and the Sea, both held by the enemies, now thence, then from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> often from both ſides at once, aſſailed by dangerous invaſions of the enemies ſhipps.

But a ſpy ſent by <hi>Aldegund</hi> to the Camp, to take notice of the fabrick of the Bridge, and the enemies deſignes, aggravated the beſieged Cities cares, who being

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119706:45"/>the keele of the ſhip, hee made a wall of lime and brick, as it were the floar, or ground-work, one foot high, and five foot broad; and extended it the length of the Ship; then hee erected walls on each ſide the compaſſe of the foundation, three foot high, and as broad, covering them cloſe, being firſt fill'd with Gun-powder tempered by an exqniſite Art, known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The covering was of Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, Mill-ſtones, and other huge ſtones. Upon this covering hee made another height Vault-wiſe, of Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and other huge ſtones alſo, which leaning one to another made a ridge, that the ſlaughter might not onely be ſtraight forwards, but on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; within this higher vault he laid Iron and Marble balls, chaines, blocks, nailes, knives, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this wicked witty man thought moſt damageable. Laſtly, as farre as lay open between the ſides of the ſhip, and the wall and roof of the mine, he fill'd up with ſquare ſtones cloſe join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and beams faſtened with Iron. But covered, and hid all theſe things with ſtrong planks, and a brick floore, in the middle whereof hee ſet fire to a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119706:46"/>pyle of wood, (that the ſhippes might ſeeme to bee ſet out in that order to burne downe the bridge) putting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wood, pitch and brimſtone, not to bee extinguiſhed, before the mine ſhould be fir'd with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Timber,<note place="margin">Two wayes of firing the mines</note> hee fram'd two wayes to fire the Mine: In ſome of the ſhippes plac't matches beſmear'd with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, which being privily extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through part of the keele, were ſtretched into the Mine, of that length, as by a certain meaſure he had before tryed, would continue light, untill the ſhippes ſhould come to the bridge. In other ſhippes, hee uſed thoſe kinde of clockes, which are wont by an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and pleaſant Art, to be exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſtead of night-watchers to light lamps. And ſo ordered the ſtratagem, that it ſhould continue with a gentle motion of the wheeles, untill the ſhip arrived at the bridge: and then with a ſudden and violent meeting together of the wheeles, and flint, ſtrike ſome ſparcles, which recived in the bruiſed gun-powder there ſcattered, taking fire, might inflame the train there layd: and this reaching to the mouth of the Mine, might ſpeedily convey
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119706:46"/>that creeping fire into it. <hi>Jambell</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finiſhed foure ſhippes after this manner, added to them thirteen leſſer,<note place="margin">To theſe foure greater, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thirteen leſſer.</note> having within them nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but the Hatches covered with huge fires. Nor was this preparation unſeene of the Royaliſts,<note place="margin">The Royaliſts in the interim ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous.</note> although they were ignorant of the ſtratagem: who imagined the fleet was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ready in the City, to the intent the bridge might at once be aſſailed on the one ſide by the <hi>Antwerpians,</hi> and on the other by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders.</hi> Wherefore his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſtrengthening the Caſtles, and Forts with greater guards, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the bridge the chiefe of his ſouldiers, had a watchfull eye to the enemies deſignes: who by how much hee ſeemed the better prepared to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſlaughter,<note place="margin">The ſhippes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from the City.</note> was ſo much neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to receive it. When behold from the City there appeared three ſhippes brightly ſhining with fire,<note place="margin">8. Aprill.</note> and a little after followed others, and after thoſe others. Then all the noyſe in the Camp was arme arme, and the bridge was filled with ſouldiers. The ſhipps were carried down the river two and three together, in ſo orderly a courſe,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119706:47"/>if they were but to make a ſhew; for they were then governed by Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and the fire in every ſhip ſhined ſo clearly, that they ſeemed not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fires,<note place="margin">Their fires made a wonderfull ſhew in the night,</note> but verily to burn themſelves, and ſo fire to ſaile, and bee nouriſhed amongſt the Waters.

Then the aſpect and pomp of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Souldiers ſhining in bright Armour, their weapons drawne, and colours diſplai'd all along the bridge, augmented the Pageant. Laſtly, all things compoſed to the uncertaine pleaſure of this new Theater, both ſtruck terrour, and yet were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: they feared, and yet had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the cauſe of their feare. And

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119706:61"/>the uſe of ſayles: and contrived, that as ſayles fill'd with wind, drive on the Veſſel, ſo his new faſhioned ſayle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with water, might likewiſe move it on with this advantage, (which chiefly intended) that it would keep a direct courſe, for needs muſt the ſhip ſet forth in the middle of the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> not onely be forced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the ſayle extended before it, and filled with the ſtreame, ſo much the more violently, by how much the River runs with greater rapidity in the midſt, eſpecially when the tyde back's into the Ocean, but alſo muſt needs keep it from being driven from the deeper part of the channell by any croſſe guſt of Wind; for the Wind, which flowing above the waters, is accuſtomed to wreſt the ſhipp aſide from its right courſe could not have the like force on the under water which fill'd the ſayle, with which, the ſhip beſides the courſe of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ebbing of the Sea, was drawn on as with oares. Aſſuring himſelfe, that no Machine how ſtrong ſoever, was able to endure this violent onſet, but at the very firſt charge of this battering Ram, would faile. And now
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119706:62"/>teen of thoſe other ſhippes I ſpoke of,<note place="margin">The enemies Engines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in this order.</note> were ſent downe the midſt of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from <hi>Antwerp</hi> about mid-night: ſix of the greateſt whereof carryed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction privately within them, the reſt openly threatned fire, which were led and guarded by ſeventeene little cock-boats tyed and connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for that their bottomes were boared full of holes, and water running in, they were carryed ſcarce a foot above the river, held up onely, and hindered from ſinking by empty hogs-heads. To this intent, that ſcarce viſible, eſpecially in the dead of the night, they might, as lying lower and ſecure from danger of their ſharp beakes ſet upon the floates, plac't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bridge: and breaking downe that bar, might open a way for the ſhippes to aſſayl the bridge, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſſe. For after the overthrow received the month before, every night ſome light boats, as ſcouts, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies command, traced the <hi>Scheldt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alex.</hi> makes preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> which an Engliſh Captaine, offering his ſervice to Prince <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> for that purpoſe fortifyed with grapples, hooks, and anchors. At the fight of which, the boates being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119706:62"/>and ſcattered, were by their conductours convey'd ſome one way, ſome another, whilſt in the interim, the Royaliſts ſpeedily with their grapling hooks catching hold of moſt of the greater ſhippes then deſtitute of the leſſers conduct, drew them to the banks, and there anchored them. Where afterwards, they vented their poyſon without any execution. But having not time to ſurprize all,<note place="margin">But one brake through the floats.</note> one of them armed with thoſe ſharp weapons fell on the piled fortification that ſtood before the bridge, and after they had a while goared one another with mutuall wounds, at length the ſhip cutting in pieces the oppoſite beames,<note place="margin">And opens the paſſage for the new invented ſhip.</note> and ſhips-maſts, made a breach in the Machine it ſelfe alſo ſorely bulked, and torne in pieces by the ſharp points, was forthwith ſwallowed by the River. But that which went with ſayles faſtened to the bottom, could not by any hooks or grapples be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, but with incredible ſwiftneſſe was directly conveyed through the broken floates againſt the bridge. And although the ſouldiers forthwith took one of the ſhips from the bridge, (for then the ſhipps were ſo ordered,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119706:63"/>that they might bee removed when need required) and haſtened to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the way to the approaching ſhip,<note place="margin">Which paſt through not without ſome hurt to the bridge.</note> yet it hitting on the ſhip plac't next to that which was removed, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable force tore it aſunder, and forthwith ſunk it. And thus hitherto prevailed the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> Engines; for ſome <hi>Italians</hi> at day-break, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Torell,</hi> with great audacity boarded thoſe leſſer fire-ſhips that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and pulling moſt of them to the banks there anchored them. Yet three or foure eſcaped,<note place="margin">Others attempt the ſame.</note> but the ſhips being removed from the bridge, they ſlyded through that open way of the River,<note place="margin">But without any effect.</note> vomiting their peſtilence a great diſtance off the bridge and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of theſe ſhipps diſcharging their mines burſt a far off, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers on the bridge their feare now turned into ſport,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>And</hi> are ſcoffed at.</note> had leaſure joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vent their jeeres and iterate their triumphant ſhoutes, in deriſion of their enemies. Nor wanted there ſome, who deſirous to know the inward ſubtilty,<note place="margin">And the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtructure of them was found out.</note> entered with proſperous te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity one of the enemies ſhips, and finding the match which conveyed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119706:63"/>the fire almoſt entering the mine, forthwith extinguiſhed it, and made bold to look into the ſecret vault, and ſhewed it to others, no little admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rarity of it: from whoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations eſpecially, I received theſe things which before are related.</p>
            <p>But not long were the Royaliſts exempt from new feare &amp; care, to wit,<note place="margin">The laſt attempt of the <hi>Antwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi>
               </note> from the laſt ſtratagem of the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for as yet the <hi>Antwerpian</hi> Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers had one invention more, which they reſerved as their lateſt hopes. It was a Veſſell of an unuſuall bigneſſe,<note place="margin">A huge ſhip</note> and forme: whoſe foundation being not much unlike to Wherryes, was ſo connected together with croſſe beams, like a greate, that the places left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe beames, might bee fill'd with empty Hogs-heads, the better to ſupport the huge weight that was to be laid thereon. Moreover theſe beams and barrels were covered with thick boards pitched, to make a plaine even bottom of the ſhip: the ſides were fenced with impregnable battlements, and thick ranked with Wall pieces. But upon this ſhipp covered with ſtrong planks, there was raiſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it were a Caſtle, built almoſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119706:64"/>foure-ſquare; in which were carried above a thouſand Muſqueteers, beſides thoſe that appeared not, being in the lower ſhip, and thoſe that were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the view in the top-Caſtles of the maſt, to ſhoot as it were a ſtorme of leaden hail-ſtones from the clouds. But it is ſcarce credible how great confidence the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> repoſed in this ſhip, than which there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any built at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter induſtry, or expences; for it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it was ſeven moneths in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and coſt at leaſt one hundred thouſand florens, ſo much were they taken with this huge moveable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and all ſecure of its ſucceſſe, that proudly they named it the END OF THE WARR;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> The end of the Warr.</note> and were willing the enemies ſhould take notice of that glorious Title they gave it, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there Engine or ſtratagem more vainer,<note place="margin">But took no effect.</note> or to leſſe purpoſe. For launched into the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> and ſteered through the cleft of the River-bank at <hi>Oſtervele,</hi> into the drowned fields, the Marriners could ſcarcely guide it: and no ſooner came it neer to <hi>Ordam,</hi> which Fort it aſſaulted but it ſtuck faſt to the ground, and was ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119706:64"/>that from thence it could not by any Art of Marriners, any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of other ſhippes be drawn, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. So THINGS that exceed cuſtome and meaſure in greatneſſe, are rather for ſight-ſake, then uſe and commodity, of which the <hi>Antwerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had a ſufficient experience,<note place="margin">Afterwards they termed it expences loſt.</note> who afterwards with a truer Title call'd this their Fabrick, <hi>Money caſt away;</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after the firſt ſight and encounter, in a military jeere call'd it CARANTAMAVLA <hi>viz.</hi> a great Bug-bare for children.<note place="margin">And a Bugbear for children.</note> But this was afterwards, for then, when they heard it was ſet out of the Port,<note place="margin">In the interim it kept the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts ſolicitous at the bridge.</note> and ſuppoſed it to come againſt the bridge, (for ſo the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> gave it out, to detaine the Royaliſts on the bridge) they expreſſed another front, and earneſtly prepared all their forces againſt this new monſter, which ſame had divulged.</p>

               <hi>Alexanders</hi> abſence, and ſaid, he was to be ſent for with all ſpeed: and it was not to be doubted, but all things by his preſence would be reſtored. But as it is accuſtomed to fall out in ſuch like deſperate affaires, MANY give Counſell, few will undergo the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill.

Indeed, hee did not attribute to himſelfe and his Regiment more then to the reſt, yet could he not deny but hee was more obliged and devoted to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119706:69"/>the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> then others. And from thence had hee greater provocation to the enterprize. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what others doubted and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, hee earneſtly deſired for himſelfe and his Regiment, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſet upon the enemies, and in the front, if others would follow: or if they diffided and would leave the glory to them alone, they onely would engage, and as hee hoped be Victorious. Hee knew his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers minds and courages, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee doubted not, but to bee freed from oſtentation and temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And doubted not but what things were proudly ſpoken at the Table would as gallantly bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the battle.

Wee turned the <hi>Scheldt</hi> into the fields, and ſought paſſage elſ-where: You following the River hither alſo, by a new bridge divided it, and objected that over-croſſe Cauſey againſt our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies. We aſſayled the Cauſey, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it through, and opened a way there for our ſhipping: yet you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſt us thence; when wee thought our ſelves Victours, made up the clefts and breaches, and obſtructed all hope of paſſage: What Engines, what ſtratagems have wee left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted? What ſtrength of navies, what fiery wonders, what inventions of ſwimming Caſtles, can there bee, we have not ſet forth? as much as by wit, as much as by art, could be imagined, we have performed.

You have atchieved moſt invict &amp; illuſtrious Prince an enterprize; than which the paſt and preſent Annalls cannot produce a greater. We often have read and ſometimes beheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a Generall laying ſiege to an hoſtile City whil'ſt hee forceth and taketh one, hath loſt another elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.

As if to fight with one enemy at once, were too ſmall a taske for your noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But the recitall of all theſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119706:87"/>diſputes betwixt the beſieged, and beſiegers, tends onely to this, that it may plainly appeare, that we, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of our owne forces did not raſhly undertake our defence, nor having had tryall of your fortune do cowardly give it up. God, and your valour (O <hi>Alexander</hi>) have afforded you the glory of ſubduing <hi>Antwerp:</hi> and poſterity will allow us alſo ſome honour, for not yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too haſtily: One thing as well for yours, &amp; the King your Uncles ſake, as our owne, wee intreat and earneſtly requeſt; that as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering you have underſtood how great a City you have overcome, ſo in taking and poſſeſſing it, you will diminiſh nothing of the majeſty &amp; ſtrength thereof, nothing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of your Victory, nor any thing of his Majeſties poſſeſſion and tribute. But diminiſh them you will, if either by confining the Citizens minds to a certaine religion, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a garriſon of externs over their bodies and fortunes; you change the ſtate and Government of the City. <hi>Antwerp,</hi> if any City in all Europe, flouriſheth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119706:87"/>The number of Citizens, and ſtrangers can ſcarcely bee reckoned. The <hi>Scheldt</hi> as large as it is, cannot containe the Merchants ſhippes of all regions, when warr hinders them not. Laſtly, no Empory in the whole world conjoynes &amp; aſſociates more Provinces together, and wealth of countreyes by communion of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick. The fame of the place will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, as long as ſolitude of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, threats of Caſtles and terrours of a Garriſon do not ſhut up this Sanctuary.

Surely this City hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently had a lamentable &amp; grievous experiment of ſacking, burning and plundering. For the prevention of which outrages, that <hi>Antwerp</hi> may have no juſt cauſe for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to feare your prudence (moſt excellent Prince) by this dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, for which we are come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to treat with you, we hope will provide.</q>

In ſtating the conditions he would bury in oblivion the <hi>Amwerpians</hi> Delinquencies, for having waged warr againſt God and their lawfull Soveraigne: and incited others of the Low-countreys, as with an allarme from that ſtrong hold, to defection; but would rather have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Majeſties clemency, and from thence would moderate the chiefeſt of their conditions.<note place="margin">And diſmiſſeth them to three Preſidents.</note> In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim hee had appointed men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding &amp; wiſdome, and no ways partiall, with whom they might more freely conferre.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119706:88"/>
               <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Mechlin:</hi> and committed every thing to their judgement and wiſdome;<note place="margin">To whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all things: except the Articles of obedience to the King and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> the Articles pertaining to obedience due to the King and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely excepted: which hee with more then ordinary care as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an expreſſe from his Majeſty, reſerved to himſelfe; for when long agoe his Excellency had propoſed it to the King, (thereby to make the <hi>Ant verpians</hi> more willing to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) whether hee ſhould ſet a certaine time to the Hereticks, wherein to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch their affaires, or to permit them ſo long untill there might be hopes of their better diſpoſition and reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; His Majeſty made reply,<note place="margin">The King thus expreſſeth his mind concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion.</note> that he ſhould not grant an unlimited time, what hope or perſwaſion ſoever there was of their reconciliation. Upon which ſubject, becauſe hee had often at other times treated, I thought it beſt to inſert one of the lateſt letters from <hi>Spaine,</hi> concerning this matter, part of which was written with his Majeſties own hand. <q>In every trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or parley with Cities or Caſtles, that come into our hands, let this be your firſt, and laſt regard, that in theſe places, the Catholick religion

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119706:89"/>to preferr the ſervice due to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſecular buſineſſe. But if God by reaſon of our great offences, will have it otherwiſe, I think it better to ſpend all my Kingdomes for his ſake, then for any humane reſpect, to decline from this, if not a lucky, doubtleſſe a pious determination.</q> And truly this firme purpoſe of his Catholick Majeſty was very apparent to be acceptable to God; for on the ſame day theſe were written by the King, which was the ſeventeenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on the ſame day the <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpian</hi> agents at their meeting at <hi>Bevera,</hi> receiving their articles, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the City.

That religion, as then it was, might freely bee exerciſed; that the Caſtle now halfe down, might not be repaired; That no garriſon of what nation ſoever, might be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City.
